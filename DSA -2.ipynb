    "Given an integer array `nums` of 2n integers, group these integers into n pairs `(a1, b1), (a2, b2),..., (an, bn)` such that the sum of `min(ai, bi)` for all `i` is maximized. Return the maximized sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "Input: `nums = [1,4,3,2]`\n",
    "Output: `4`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** All possible pairings (ignoring the ordering of elements) are:\n",
    "1. `(1, 4), (2, 3) -> min(1, 4) + min(2, 3) = 1 + 2 = 3`\n",

    "So the maximum possible sum is 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "To maximize the sum of minimum pairs, we need to sort the array `nums` in ascending order. Then, we can pair the elements at even indices with each other, as they will be the minimum values in each pair. The sum of these minimum values will be the maximum possible sum.

    "Alice has n candies, where the ith candy is of type `candyType[i]`. Alice noticed that she started to gain weight, so she visited a doctor. The doctor advised Alice to only eat `n / 2` of the candies she has (n is always even). Alice likes her candies very much, and she wants to eat the maximum number of different types of candies while still following the doctor's advice. Given the integer array `candyType` of length `n`, return the maximum number of different types of candies she can eat if she only eats `n / 2` of them.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "To determine the maximum number of different types of candies Alice can eat, we need to count the number of unique candy types in the array `candyType`.

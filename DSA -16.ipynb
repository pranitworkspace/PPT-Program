    "To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of the indices of elements in decreasing order of their frequencies. We iterate through the given array from right to left and for each element, we compare its frequency with the frequency of the element at the top of the stack. If the current element has a greater frequency, we pop elements from the stack until we find an element with a greater frequency or the stack becomes empty. The element at the top of the stack after this process will be the next greater frequency element for the current element. If the stack is empty, there is no element to the right with a greater frequency.\n",

    "ðŸ’¡ **Question 1:** Given a singly linked list, delete the middle node of the linked list. If there are even nodes, delete the second middle node. If the input linked list is NULL or has 1 node, return NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** To delete the middle node of a singly linked list, we can use the fast and slow pointer approach. The fast pointer moves two nodes at a time while the slow pointer moves one node at a time. By the time the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle (or second middle) node. We can then remove the node pointed by the slow pointer.\n",

    "ðŸ’¡ **Question 2:** Given a linked list, check if it contains a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** We can use Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm to check if a linked list contains a loop. The algorithm uses two pointers, one slow and one fast, to traverse the list. If there is a loop, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:** To find the Nth node from the end of a linked list, we can use two pointers approach. We initialize two pointers, main_ptr and ref_ptr, both pointing to the head of the list. We move the ref_ptr N nodes ahead. Then, we move both pointers one node at a time until ref_ptr reaches the end of the list. At this point, main_ptr will be pointing to the Nth node from the end.\n",

We can use the slow and fast pointer approach to find the middle of the list. Then, we reverse the second half and compare it with the first half node by node.\n",
